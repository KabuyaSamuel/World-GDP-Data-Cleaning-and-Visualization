# Project - World GDP
The World GDP dataset provides information about the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of countries worldwide from the year 1980 to 2023. GDP represents the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. This dataset includes data for each country, allowing for comprehensive analysis and comparison of economic growth and development.

##  World GDP Exploration
Your task is to explore and visualize this dataset using the techniques you've learnt during the week. Analyzing the World GDP dataset through visualization can yield valuable insights, such as helping us understand global economic trends, identify countries with significant GDP growth or decline, and explore patterns over time.

For instance, we can create line plots to visualize the changes in GDP for different countries over the years. This allows us to observe the overall economic trajectory of nations, identify periods of rapid growth or recession, and compare the economic performance of different regions.
